# Sorting Visualizer

This repository contains the code of my project: Sorting Visualizer. As the name suggests, the program would help us see the sorting algorithm working in real time with variable array sizes. 

## Update
You can now use it to visualize the 3 basic sorts: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort and Selection Sort. I will soon add functionality to other sorting algorithms and try to make UI better.
