# Sorting Visualizer

This repository contains the code of my project: Sorting Visualizer. As the name suggests, the program would help us see the sorting algorithm working in real time with variable array sizes. 

You can now use it to visualize the: 
- Merge Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort

## Update
I will soon add functionality to other sorting algorithms and try to make UI better.
