# Sorting Visualizer

This repository contains the code of my project: Sorting Visualizer. As the name suggests, the program would help us see the sorting algorithm working in real time with variable list/array sizes which are represented by bars of different lengths. 

You can now use it to visualize the: 
- Merge Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Quick Sort

## What I Learnt

- Learned about different sorting algorithms and time complexities, O(n^2) for Bubble, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort and O(nlogn) for Quick and Merge Sort.
- How to make GUI with Tkinter
- How to incorporate geometrical figures (rectangles in this case) with an element of a/an list/array and draw them on canvas
- Learned about different widgets of Tkinter

### Update
I will soon add functionality to other sorting algorithms and try to make UI better.
